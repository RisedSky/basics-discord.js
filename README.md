# How to get package.json?
1: download node.js in your pc

2: run this in your cmd `npm init` then `npm install` 

and if you want to install a package type `npm i <package name>` or `npm uninstall <package name>` to uninstall it

# __can I make more than one command and how__?
```js
if (command === 'ping'){
massage.channel.send('pong');
} else if{
//code ...
}
```
quick note: copy and paste will not work you must change some things
note 2: doing if, elseif, elseif commands are not the good way to do ! Search for Command Handler !
